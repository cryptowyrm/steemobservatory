    <h1>Steem Observatory Info</h1>
    
    <p>Steem Observatory is a little statistics App I am developing right now for <a target="_blank" href="https://steemit.com/">Steem</a>, the blockchain based social network. I use <a target="_blank" href="https://jnordberg.github.io/dsteem/">dsteem</a> to contact Steem's API and the site is written in the <a target="_blank" href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a> programming language using the <a target="_blank" href="http://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a> framework, which is a minimalistic wrapper on top of the widely popular <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> framework.</p>
    
    <h2>How to use?</h2>
    <p>Steem Observatory is intended to be easy to use, basically a dashboard for your Steem account, so there is not a lot you need to know. Click on the username at the top, which will be my own (crypticwyrm) when you visit the site for the first time, enter your own Steem username instead and click ok, then your data will get loaded and used from then on when you visit the site.</p>
    
    <p>You can click on the big green or red circles in front of posts to open a list of votes and statistics about votes the selected post has received. A green circle means the post can still make money (posts on Steem can make money in the first 7 days after they have been posted).</p>
    
    <p>If you have enabled the <b>Auto refresh</b> option, the Steem network is contacted every 60 seconds to update the data that is displayed. You could for example make the window really small and move it to the side of the screen, the design is reponsive so the app will fit the small window perfectly, and then you have a live updating overview of your Steem account, to always see how much money your posts are making and if there are new comments.</p>
